# cs432_autotests

Python script for automating test creation
This uses a local test.decaf file (which should be in your project folder)
and the reference compiler given to create input, output and expected files. Make sure both this file and a copy of decaf are in your project folder! It works by copying the contents inside of test.decaf and creates a new test based on the code inside of it!
